These instructions assume you’re starting from a freshly created Plex account using the web version of Plex. The process is almost identical on most platforms, including mobile and smart TV apps.

## 1. Accept Server Share Invitation
- You should have recieved an email invitation, click the link and log in with your Plex account. 
- If you didn't receive an email let me know.

## 2. Go to “More” to Customize Homepage
- On the Plex homepage, click the **More** button on the left sidebar to reveal additional libraries and sections. You can now see all available libraries, including those from shared servers.

## 3. Unpin Default Items (Optional)
- For a cleaner look, unpin default sections you don’t want by clicking the three-dot (⋮) menu on each and selecting “Unpin from home.” I personally find them annoying on my homepage but this is personal preference.

- After unpinning, your homepage should look less cluttered.

## 4. Pin Shared Libraries
- Under the server: isah (Cereberus)
- Click the three-dot (⋮) menu next to each library (e.g., Movies, TV Shows) and select “Pin”
- Pin items in your desired order; they will be displayed on your homepage in the same sequence.

## 5. Your Customized Homepage
- Your homepage should now display only your chosen libraries, in your preferred order.
- You can always add, remove, or re-order pins later.
